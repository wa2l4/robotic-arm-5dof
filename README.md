#5-Freedom Robotic Project

This is a project for a robotic arm with 5 freedoms. The model is saved in 3D STL format.

## âœ… Project Description

The robotic arm includes the following 5 degrees of freedom:
1. **Base Rotation** (Yaw)
2. **Shoulder Joint** (Pitch)
3. **Elbow Joint** (Pitch)
4. **Wrist 1** (Yaw)
